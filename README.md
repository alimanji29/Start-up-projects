Greetings wonderful viewer,

The files you see located above are projects I made throughout my internship which is still ongoing, I hope to add more files to the repository. 

Below is a short description for each file.

RPS game
Its Rock-Paper-Scissors(duh), makes use of the random module in Python to pick a random value from a list, and then the player is asked to input their choice between the 3 options. Once all the picking is done, the script compares the choices of the player and the randomly selected choice, to produce a winner and a loser, the script then questions the player if they want to play again, if they agree, the loop will start over, if not the loop breaks

more descriptions will be added once i get some free time
